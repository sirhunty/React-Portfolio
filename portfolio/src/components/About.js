                    <p>Web Developer experienced in Agile development deliveries. I can successfully maintain front and
                        back end existing code and create web applications. Within my last role, I successfully
                        maintained multiple product account configurations and support channels for internal and
                        external use. What motivates me as a web developer is to become a part of a team where I can
                        utilize my knowledge and skills while learning from my peers. I have a Bachelorâ€™s in Graphic
                        Design and earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Arizona. Skills
                        attained from this course are React, MySQL, and Node to name a few. I feel the combination of my
                        technical expertise, passion to learn, and leadership experience makes me an advantageous
                        candidate for any development team.</p>
